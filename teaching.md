# Teaching

I teach a variety of courses, largely focused on programming
languages, compilers, and security.

### [CIS 352](https://kmicinski.com/cis352-f22/) -- Principles of Programming Languages

I am the lead instructor of CIS352, Principles of Programming
Languages, every Fall/Spring at Syracuse. The course is a
project-focused introduction to the design, semantics, and
implementation of modern higher-order programming languages. Course
projects give students significant programming skills that involve
building fragments of interpreters and compilers. The course uses the
Racket programming language, and involves the implementation of
Scheme-like languages; topics in other programming paradigms
(object-oriented, imperative, or logic) are discussed upon
occasion. Because our introductory sequence uses Haskell, CIS352's
initial focus is on untyped operational semantics, moving into
concepts from type theory as the course progresses. Current course
projects include network connectivity, ASCII-art rendering, Church
encoding, metacircular interpreters, and type system implementation.

The <a

2022 version</a> of my course is available freely on YouTube, and
currently includes 22 lectures between 10 and 35 minutes. I work to
release several update videos from time to time (specifically to
correct errata and refresh course content).

### [CIS 700, Fall 2023](http://kmicinski.com/cis700-f23)

This PhD-level seminar is "Formal Methods and Modern Symbolic AI." The
course is an in-depth exploration of modern research in automated
reasoning, including SAT (DPLL, CDCL), SMT, first-order reasoning,
intuitionistic type theory, model checking, equational reasoning,
Datalog, ASP, and related paradigms.

### [CIS 700, Fall 2022](http://kmicinski.com/cis700-f22)

This PhD-level seminar is "Language-Based Security." We discuss
relevant particulars of programming language semantics and logic. We
then move to discussing topics such as hyperproperties, security type
systems, and full abstraction.

### [CIS 700, Fall 2020/21](http://kmicinski.com/program-analysis)

This PhD seminar course focuses on the theory and practice of static
analysis. We first cover standard formulations of programming langauge
semantics (e.g., metacircular interpreters, big/small-step sematics)
and continue by introducing ideas from lattice theory, abstract
interpretation, and abstract-machine-based analysis techniques.

The [2021 version](https://kmicinski.com/cis700-f21/) focused on malware analysis.

### [CMSC 245, Spring 2019](http://kmicinski.com/cs245)

This is the second iteration of my programming languages course at
Haverford.

### [CMSC 395, Fall 2018](http://kmicinski.com/mobile-apps)

CS 395 is a project-based course that teaches software
engineering by pairing student groups with nonprofit groups for which
they build apps. I was really proud of the course outcomes, and we
were able to work with some really awesome organizations.

### [CMSC 107, Fall 2018](http://kmicinski.com/cs107)

![Path finding project in CS 107]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/path.png)

Fall 2018 I taught a revamped version of the introductory course at
Haverford. My offering was fairly unique in that I replaced all of the
course projects with incremental assignments that had students write
core data structures and eventually built up to the implementation a
tile-based videogame (complete with enemy AI!). A few example projects
are available [here](https://github.com/kmicinski/cs107-p6),
[here](https://github.com/kmicinski/cs107-p3), and
[here](https://github.com/kmicinski/cs107-p7).

### [CMSC 311, Spring 2018](http://kmicinski.com/cybersecurity-course)

Spring 2018 I taught a new course in computer security. We covered a
broad set of attacks and defenses. Students work end-to-end course
projects, and hold each other accountable by finding exploits and
breaking each other's projects.

### [CMSC 245, Fall 2017](http://kmicinski.com/cmsc245)

The course covers programming paradigms at several different levels of
hardware abstraction, and teaches students to both understand how the
machine executes code and its core abstractions for representing
data. The main course website is [here](http://kmicinski.com/cmsc245).

### [CMSC 330, Summer 2015](https://cs.umd.edu/class/summer2015/cmsc330/)

[Link to GitHub repository with examples](https://github.com/kmicinski/cmsc330examples)

As a PhD student in programming languages during the summer of 2015, I
taught CMSC 330, an undergraduate course in PL at Maryland.  CMSC 330
covers a wide range of concepts in programming languages: both
foundational and practical. In particular, the students learn OCaml,
Ruby, and Prolog, and learn core material such as automata theory
(finite state machines and grammars) and programming language
semantics.

For the Summer 2015 iteration of the course, I reworked a large part
of the lectures to cover the same set of material, but presented it in
an interactive style: developing concepts in class, while
supplementing this development with projects and course notes. I also
elected to put more emphasis on teaching functional programming and
programming language semantics. The course included extensive coverage
of small step semantics: for one project students implement an
interpreter for a core-ML.

Relevant lecture material I particular enjoyed writing includes:

- [A set of lecture notes on introductory functional programming](https://github.com/kmicinski/cmsc330examples/tree/master/ocaml)

- [Notes on the lambda calculus and introductory semantics in the big, small, and abstract machine style](https://github.com/kmicinski/cmsc330examples/tree/master/lambda-calculus)

- [Notes on the OCaml module system](https://github.com/kmicinski/cmsc330examples/tree/master/module-systems)
