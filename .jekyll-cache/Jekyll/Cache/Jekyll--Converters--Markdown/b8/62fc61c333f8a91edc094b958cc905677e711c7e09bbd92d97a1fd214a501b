<p>My goal is to keep users secure as they use modern systems. This is a
challenging problem. Writing secure code is hard. Checking untrusted
code is even harder. Developers are not always incentivized towards
security. In some cases it is not always clear what security even
means.</p>

<p>For example, consider an app that shows users nearby coffee shops
frequented by their friends. Such an app may leak or store the userâ€™s
location (e.g., to an ad provider) in a way they do not
intend. Sometimes, the developer is not even aware they are violating
the userâ€™s privacy (for example, if the developer uses an ad library
and they are unaware it collects location data). Even if the developer
is aware of how location is being collected, users may not assume that
it is being stored permanently. You can look at some of my recent
<a href="/publications">publications</a> to get an idea of the projects Iâ€™m
currently working on to help solve these problems.</p>

<p>To help achieve this goal, I use techniques from the following areas:</p>

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>Security is a broad area, but unified by a common challenge:
      identifying gaps between abstractions that allow potential
      attackers to exploit systems. I frequently use definitions from
      security such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interference_(security)">noninterference</a>
      and techniques such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_isolation">process
      isolation</a>. My current work addresses key challenges in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering">reverse
      engineering</a></p>

   <td id="pldesc" class="areadescleft" style="display:none">
      <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>Reasoning about a program's security requires being able to
      precisely define its
      behavior. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory">Programming language theory</a>
      allows us to treat programs as artifacts. I frequently use
      techniques from PL to define and reason about programs. Some of
      these techniques include
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis">static analysis</a>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_interpretation">abstract interpretation</a>
      and

      <h3>Systems</h3>
      <hr />

      <p>Theory is useful for formally arguing about what security
      means and how to enforce it. But ultimately we want to
      <i>implement</i> our ideas in real systems. A core focus of my
      work is to scale well-engineered solutions to challenging
      problems up to production systems.</p>

<p>Note that I am particularly excited to collaborate with Syracuse
students. As you can likely tell from this page, my research is
generally in programming languages, but related areas (especially
computer security) also appeal to me. If you would like to pursue
undergraduate research, please drop me a line so we can discuss!</p>
