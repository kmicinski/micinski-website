I"Ö<p>Here‚Äôs the tip: have your computer read your writing back to
you. Listen to how it sounds. Then, iterate until it conveys what
you‚Äôd like to hear. On a mac, you can do this it like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>say -r words_per_minute "My speech goes here"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I do this to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Read the text back to me quickly (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-r 240-270</code>). This helps follow
along with a document in front of me and check it for flow. It also
catches miswordings, (some) grammar errors, and typos.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Close my eyes, sit back, and really try to absorb the text. I listen
slowly, around 180-200 words per minute. This allows me to hear
places where the text sounds awkward or redundant.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BUGS-Writing-Revised-Guide-Debugging/dp/020137921X">BUGS in
Writing</a>
talks at length about developing an ‚Äúear‚Äù for good writing. While I
found the book‚Äôs content useful, it‚Äôs decidedly hard to be able to
objectively ‚Äúhear‚Äù your own writing. I have a tough time divorcing the
process of reading from pondering over the endless ways I could
improve any given sentence.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve found that listening to the text spoken back to you is a great
way to perform rapid prototyping on documents. For example, I wrote a
rough draft of this post, listened to it, and then restructured based
on what I heard. I don‚Äôt think of myself as a naturally good
writer. Forcing myself to slow down and concentrate naturally shifts
my sentences towards being shorter and more concise.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs an example from the syllabus for my upcoming security course,
which I was editing today:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To understand how attackers think, we will learn about the attacks
they employ. But understanding a collection of attacks is not alone
sufficient for helping us understand how to build secure systems. So
alongside attacks, we will also cover the theory behind building
defenses into our systems. We will dissect a number of real-world
attacks (such as Heartbleed or WannaCry) and reflect upon what could
have been done to prevent them. To complement these examples, will
learn the theoretical underpinnings of security that apply across
systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I spent some amount of time going over this text, but never really
‚Äúheard‚Äù it all together. When I did, I immediately identified the
problem: the paragraph was saying the same thing twice, breaking the
natural flow.</p>

<p>I then came up with this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To understand how attackers think, we will learn about the attacks
they employ. We will dissect a number of real-world attacks (such as
Heartbleed or WannaCry) and reflect upon what could have been done
to prevent them. But understanding a collection of attacks is not
alone sufficient for helping us understand how to build secure
systems. So alongside attacks, we will also learn the theoretical
underpinnings of security, and use it to build defenses into our
systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which sounds a lot better to me!</p>

<p>By the way, I learned this trick from Philip Guo:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Do other people do this too? I often use text-to-speech to have my computer/phone read my own writing back to me to sense how it sounds</p>&mdash; Philip Guo (@pgbovine) <a href="https://twitter.com/pgbovine/status/910182577767514113">September 19, 2017</a></blockquote>
