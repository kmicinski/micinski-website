I"y<p>This post is about transparency with your advisor. It seems like most
problems that PhD students face boil down to communication and
transparency: students work on something the advisor doesn’t expect,
the advisor has different expectations for number of papers required
to graduate, student collaborates with someone when the advisor
doesn’t expect them to, etc…</p>
