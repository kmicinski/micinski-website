Recently I reflected on the kinds of problems I've worked on during my
PhD, and in doing so realized that I likely did not fully appreciate
what research was until rather recently.

Research is about identifying and solving novel, important, and
generalizable problems inherent in nature. Looking back on the
problems I've solved for my PhD, I realize that I might have (at the
time) confused the *methods* used to tackle the research with the
research itself.

I think this conflation is easy for any student to make, because it is
the natural conclusion of the path you take before you start your
PhD. In undergrad, you struggle (and succeed!) to understand complex
technical devices used to solve problems. For example, a CS major may
learn proof mechanisms such as the pumping lemma, diagonalization, or
proof by structural induction. It feels natural upon starting your PhD
to assume that research will be challenging in a similar way. For me,
this was exacerbated by the fact that I saw so many technical devices
used in research that I hadn't encountered in my undergrad: things
like Coq, category theory, and abstract interpretation.

In light of seeing these things, it feels natural to assume that the
road to doing good research is climbing the mountain of concepts until
you get to the hardest one you can find, and to keep working on
it. For example, I assumed that CS research entailed extending Coq,
category theory, or abstract interpretation. This is partially true
(in fact, these are areas of research), but taking this viewpoint
leaves out a large amount of equally (or more) important vision of
research that merely leverages those techniques to explore some other
problem.

Throughout my PhD I was challenged by this misconception, and I think
if I had identified it earlier on I could have done even more (and
better) research. In particular, confusing the techniques used to
accomplish research with problems proper leads to a very limited set
of problems to solve. Worse: it leads to problems that have been well
explored by many people.

Eventually I realized that the quality of research was not determined
by the complexity of the mechanics, but instead the merit of the
problem itself. Instead of judging problems by how much math (or code,
or person-hours, etc..) would be required to accomplish them, I judge
problems by how clearly they identify a disjoint area of study which
may not have been obvious previously.

Taking this viewpoint has a large set of positive consequences:

- You can stop worrying that you aren't smart enough to solve
  problems. Research is about identifying useful problems, but useful
  problems don't have to be challenging per se. Of course, figuring
  out how to distill a complex problem into simple pieces is often
  exactly the challenging part of research.

- I can start with a question I care about and find interesting
  technical work by assessing the gap between the current technical
  solutions and my problem.

- My research interests branch out beyond a subfield of computer
  science to expand to all of science as a whole. Instead of viewing
  myself as someone who works on problems X, Y, and Z, I can view
  myself as someone who works on problems, and is influenced by (but
  does not exclusively use) X, Y, and Z.

Taking this viewpoint of research has also helped contextualize the
research I have done into a broader narrative of what I think of as
the set of problems I care about.
