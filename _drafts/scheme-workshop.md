This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the workshop on [Scheme
and Functional Programming](http://www.schemeworkshop.org/). The
Scheme Workshop represents a rich and diverse community centered
around several broad themes. To celebrate twenty years of this
culture, I'd like you to consider submitting a paper!
